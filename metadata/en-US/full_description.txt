This is an alternative F-Droid client which is based on the older UI of the official Client (pre 1.0).
While I think that the new client UI looks pretty, it's sometimes quite clunky.
Lots of information that was provided clearly in the old UI is now not available or hidden behind more taps now.
This project is probably aimed more at the power user who values function over form. Or people who absolutely cannot stand the tile-based new UI.
